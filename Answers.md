1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

In the 'server-side routing', the entire page is reloaded every time a link is clicked or the URL is changed, which wastes time and can frustrate users. With 'client-side routing', the JavaScript prevents activating the server and telling it to reload as the resources are already available through its component-based architecture.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

HTTP is an acronym that stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol." It is a set of rules that control the way that web browsers communicate with web servers through the internet.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update, and Delete." 

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

For the "Create" in Crud, you would use the .post method, which asks the server to create/add new resourses.
For "Read," you would use the .get method to take in data from a specific resource.
For "Update," you can use the .put method, which makes changes to the specified resourse.
For "Delete," you can use .remove, which, obviously, removes or deletes resources from the server.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

Axios, HTML, and fetch API, I believe.
